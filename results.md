The tutorial setup shows how to make a simple sim.
I've made a more complicated simulation geometry and describing the results here.

The geometry is a tapered stripline design that looks like this:

At a frequency of 2.7 GHz, we get the magnetic field $B_x$ value
The side view is

Zooming in near the microstrip, 
<img src='./images/results_05.png' width="700" height="500">
<img src='./images/results_06.png' width="700" height="500">

By the simulation this design gives a magnetic flux density of ~20 mT near the surface. 


So now we can examine the performance across a range of frequencies, 100 MHz - 8 GHz.
