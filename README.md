Describing some of the simulations of a MW stripline here.
We use the striplines for quantum sensing experiments, as described in some of our group's papers:
* [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c02495](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c02495)

For step by step instructions follow the tutorial. It describes a simple, no frills setup and simulation of the waveguide. To run more complicated simulations you need to define your own geometry and replicate the sim.

To look at the final data plots and various quantities of interest, look at the results.

<!-- Todo: -->
<!-- * Reproduce entire tutorial -->
<!-- * Show Bx, By, Bz in the sim -->
<!-- * Show S11 S12 across frequecies -->
<!-- * Upload the comsol file? -->
